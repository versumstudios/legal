<h2>Contributing Code</h2>
<p>
  We try to follow the
  <a
    href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow"
    >git flow</a
  >
  development model. Which means that we have a develop branch and main branch.
  All development is done under feature branches, which are (when finished)
  merged into the development branch. When a new version is released we merge
  the develop branch into the master branch.
</p>
<p>
  If your change is minor, please feel free to submit a
  <a href="https://github.com/versumstudios/versum.xyz/pulls">pull request</a>.
  If your change is larger, or adds a feature, please file an issue beforehand
  so that we can discuss the change. You&#39;re welcome to file an
  implementation pull request immediately as well, although we generally lean
  towards discussing the change and then reviewing the implementation
  separately.
</p>
<h3>Finding something to work on</h3>
<p>
  If you want to write some code, but don&#39;t know where to start or what you
  might want to do, take a look at the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/versumstudios/versum.xyz/labels/good%20first%20issue"
    >Good First Issue</a
  >
  label on our
  <a href="https://github.com/versumstudios/versum.xyz/issues">issues</a> page.
</p>
<p>
  If you need help before you can start work, you can comment on the issue, and
  we will try to help as best we can.
</p>
<h3>Unit testing</h3>
<p>
  Always write unit tests to validate your code. Have a look at our
  <a
    href="https://github.com/versumstudios/versum.xyz/tree/develop/src/components/example"
    >example component</a
  >
</p>
<h3>Storybook stories</h3>
<p>
  If you&#39;re contributing with a new component, you need to create a
  Storybook story for it. Have a look at our
  <a
    href="https://github.com/versumstudios/versum.xyz/tree/develop/src/components/example"
    >example component</a
  >
</p>
<h3>Code Standards</h3>
<p>We recommend you install ESLint and Prettier on your IDE.</p>
<h2>Code review</h2>
<p>
  All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. It
  is almost never the case that a pull request is accepted without some changes
  requested, so please do not be offended!
</p>
<p>
  When you have finished making requested changes to your pull request, please
  make a comment containing &quot;PTAL&quot; (Please Take Another Look) on your
  pull request. GitHub notifications can be noisy, and it is unfortunately easy
  for things to be lost in the shuffle.
</p>
<p>
  Once your PR is approved (hooray!), the reviewer will squash your commits into
  a single commit and then merge the commit onto the develop branch. Thank you!
</p>
<h2>Github code review workflow conventions</h2>
<p>(For project members and frequent contributors.)</p>
<p>As a contributor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Try hard to make each Pull Request as small and focused as possible. In
    particular, this means that if a reviewer asks you to do something that is
    beyond the scope of the Pull Request, the best practice is to file another
    issue and reference it from the Pull Request rather than just adding more
    commits to the existing PR.
  </li>
  <li>
    Adding someone as a Reviewer means &quot;please feel free to look and
    comment&quot;; the review is optional. Choose as many Reviewers as you&#39;d
    like.
  </li>
  <li>
    Adding someone as an Assignee means that the Pull Request should not be
    submitted until they approve. If you choose multiple Assignees, wait until
    all of them approve. It is fine to ask someone if they are OK with being
    removed as an Assignee.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make as many commits as you want locally, but try not to push them to Github
    until you&#39;ve addressed comments; this allows the email notification
    about the push to be a signal to reviewers that the PR is ready to be looked
    at again.
  </li>
  <li>
    When there may be confusion about what should happen next for a PR, be
    explicit; add a &quot;PTAL&quot; comment if it is ready for review again, or
    a &quot;Please hold off on reviewing for now&quot; if you are still working
    on addressing comments.
  </li>
  <li>
    &quot;Resolve&quot; comments that you are sure you&#39;ve addressed; let
    your reviewers resolve ones that you&#39;re not sure about.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not use <code>git push --force</code>; this can cause comments from your
    reviewers that are associated with a specific commit to be lost. This
    implies that once you&#39;ve sent a Pull Request, you should use
    <code>git merge</code> instead of <code>git rebase</code> to incorporate
    commits from the master branch.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>As a reviewer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be timely in your review process, especially if you are an Assignee.</li>
  <li>
    Try to use <code>Start a Review</code> instead of single comments, to reduce
    email spam.
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Resolve&quot; your own comments if they have been addressed.</li>
  <li>
    If you want your review to be blocking, and are not currently an Assignee,
    add yourself as an Assignee.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When squashing-and-merging:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that <strong>all</strong> of the Assignees have approved.</li>
  <li>
    Do a final review of the one-line PR summary, ensuring that it meets the
    guidelines (e.g., &quot;blob: add more blobbing&quot;) and accurately
    describes the change.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark breaking changes with <code>BREAKING_CHANGE</code> in the commit
    message (e.g., &quot;blob: BREAKING_CHANGE remove old blob&quot;).
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the PR includes a breaking change, it will be declared via a commit
        with <code>BREAKING_CHANGE_OK</code> in it (see Contributor section
        above).
      </li>
      <li>
        You can omit the marker if the change is technically breaking, but not
        expected to affect users (e.g., it&#39;s a breaking change to an object
        that wasn&#39;t in the last tagged release, or it&#39;s a change to a
        portable API function that&#39;s only expected to be used by driver
        implementations).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Delete the automatically added commit lines; these are generally not
    interesting and make commit history harder to read.
  </li>
</ul>
